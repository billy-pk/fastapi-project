**LangChat: A Conversational AI ChatBot with Web Search Integration**

LangChat is a chatbot application built with powerful language processing tools and a user-friendly interface. This project leverages the capabilities of Langgraph/LangChain and OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model for natural language understanding and generation.

**Features**

_Language Modeling_:  LangChat uses Langgraph/LangChain and GPT-4o-mini to understand and respond to user queries in a comprehensive and informative way.

_Knowledge Base Integration_:  The chatbot first searches its internal knowledge base for answers. If a match is not found, the system seamlessly integrates with Tavily Search to retrieve relevant information from the web.

_Conversational History_:  LangChat keeps track of past interactions, allowing it to maintain context and provide more personalized responses.

_Frontend Design_:  Built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, LangChat boasts a user-friendly and responsive interface, enabling smooth user interaction.

_Backend Management_:  FastAPI handles API calls and manages the backend infrastructure, ensuring efficient communication between the chatbot and its functionalities.

**Deployment**

LangChat is currently deployed on Render.com, a cloud platform for deploying web applications.

Please note: Due to access restrictions and potential costs associated with running a deployed application, the deployment URL and instructions for accessing the live application might not be included in this public repository
