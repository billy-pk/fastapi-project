**LangChat: A Conversational AI with Web Search Integration**
LangChat is a chatbot application built with powerful language processing tools and a user-friendly interface. This project leverages the capabilities of Langgraph/LangChain and OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model for natural language understanding and generation.

**Features**
Language Modeling: LangChat uses Langgraph/LangChain and GPT-4o-mini to understand and respond to user queries in a comprehensive and informative way.
Knowledge Base Integration: The chatbot first searches its internal knowledge base for answers. If a match is not found, the system seamlessly integrates with Tavily Search to retrieve relevant information from the web.
Conversational History: LangChat keeps track of past interactions, allowing it to maintain context and provide more personalized responses.
Frontend Design: Built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, LangChat boasts a user-friendly and responsive interface, enabling smooth user interaction.
Backend Management: FastAPI handles API calls and manages the backend infrastructure, ensuring efficient communication between the chatbot and its functionalities.
**Deployment**
LangChat is currently deployed on Render.com, a cloud platform for deploying web applications.
